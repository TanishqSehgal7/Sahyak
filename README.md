Our basic Idea as a solution for deteriorating Covid-19 situation is a basic android application that supports safe route detection, stock availability and a fun section that brings down your boredom levels during the quarantine. The application comprises of three sections: 
1. Safe route Detection - It tells the safest route possible to the user where there are least no. of people so that the concept of social distancing is followed.  
2. Stock Availability - It provides information about basic amenities like groceries, green groceries, etc.  
3. Fun Section - Fun section allows us to upload the images and videos of various social events and quarantine challenges going on in the world. This ensures communication between people in a virtual manner which again promotes social distancing.
